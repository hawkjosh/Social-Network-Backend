# Social-Network-Backend

## Description

In this challenge, I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The app uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The API Routes perform RESTful CRUD operations as demonstrated in the preview video.
